Its simple and readable syntax makes it relatively easy to learn, while its many libraries and modules allow for advanced functionality.\n","\n","Python is a versatile language that can be used for various applications, from web development to data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and more. In econometrics, Python's powerful data analysis libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Statsmodels, make it an ideal tool for statistical analysis and modelling.\n","\n","### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n","\n","A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations, and text. The term \"notebook\" references the traditional notebook used in labs or research to keep track of one's work and observations.\n","\n","Jupyter notebooks support over 40 programming languages, including Python, and are widely used in data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualisation, machine learning, and more.\n","\n","Each notebook is made up of a series of cells. These cells can contain either code or markdown text. The markdown cells are used for text and include formatted text, images, hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, etc. The code cells contain the actual code that you want to run. You can run each cell individually, and it will display any output directly below the cell.\n","\n","### What is Binder?\n","\n","Binder is a free, open-source online service that allows you to turn a GitHub repository into a collection of interactive notebooks. It's powered by BinderHub, an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud. This makes it an excellent tool for sharing reproducible research, as others can view your work and interact with the code and data.\n","\n","In this class, we'll use Binder to host our Python notebooks. This means you can run and experiment with the code provided without needing to install Python or any of the necessary libraries on your local machine, and is what this notebook is running on right now.\n","\n","## Jupyter Basics\n","\n","**JupyterLab Dashboard**\n","\n","When you open a new session in Jupyter, you will be taken to the JupyterLab dashboard page.\n","\n","This page shows the file system of the machine running the Jupyter server and allows you to\n","navigate and open particular Jupyter Notebooks (or other types of files!).\n","\n","The dashboard page is shown below.\n","\n","![JupyterLab Dashboard](img/jupyterlab_dashboard.png)\n","\n","You can open existing files or change folders by double clicking on them in the left panel of the\n","dashboard (similar to a file explorer you would find on your computer).\n","\n","You can create new notebooks by clicking `Python 3` in the Launcher (see red square in the image).\n","\n","If you don't see the Launcher as one of your tabs, you can open it by clicking the `+` at the top\n","of the file explorer section of the JupyterLab dashboard (see the red circle in the image).\n","\n","**Editing Jupyter Notebooks**\n","\n","Jupyter notebooks consist of a series of cells, which can be either code cells or markdown cells.\n","A code cell contains actual code that can be run. Markdown cells contains text written in *markdown*, a simple formatting language that allows you to add headings, links, images, and more to your text.\n","\n","Once you have opened a particular notebook, you can be in one of two \"edit modes\".\n","\n","1. Command mode: This mode is for making high level changes to the notebook\n","   itself. For example changing the order of cells, creating a new cell, etc...\n","    - You know you're in command mode when a blue sidebar appears on the left of the\n","      cell.\n","    - Pressing keys tells Jupyter Notebook to run commands. For example, `a`\n","      adds a new cell above the current cell, `b` adds one below the current\n","      cell, and `dd` deletes the current cell.\n","    - up arrow (or `k`) changes the selected cell to the cell above the\n","      current one and down arrow (or `j`) changes to the cell below.\n","    - You can also use the buttons at the top of the notebook to run commands.\n","      For example, the `+` button adds a new cell below the current cell and the\n","      scissors button deletes the current cell.\n","      ![Buttons](img/buttons.png)\n","    - You can choose what type of cell you want to create by clicking the\n","      dropdown menu that says `Code` in the image above. You can choose between\n","      `Code`, `Markdown` (for text), and `Raw`.\n","2. Edit mode: Used when editing the content inside of cells.\n","    - When in edit mode, the selected cell displays a green sidebar on left.\n","    - Can edit the content of a cell.\n","\n","Some useful commands:\n","\n","- To go from command mode to edit mode, press enter or double click the mouse\n","- Go from edit mode to command mode by pressing escape\n","- You can evaluate a cell by pressing `Shift + Enter` (meaning `Shift` and `Enter` at\n","  the same time)\n","\n","Note that the order you run cells matters. If you run a cell that defines a variable, you need to run that cell before you run any cells that use that variable. You can also only run a whole cell at a time, so if you want to run a particular line of code, you need to put it in its own cell.\n","\n","**Important** - These notebooks are being run on a remote server, and will not save your work if you close the browser tab. If you want to save your work, you can download the notebook by clicking the download button. You can then re-upload this notebook or open it in JupyterLab on your local machine.\n","![Download Button](img/download.png)\n","\n","The notebooks will also time out after a certain amount of inactivity. If you leave a notebook open for a while without running any cells, you may need to refresh the page to get it to work again which will clear any unsaved work.\n","\n","## Python Basics\n","\n","\n","### Variables\n","Variable assignment associates a value to a variable.\n","\n","Below, we assign the value “Hello World” to the variable x."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7ed153ad","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Run the cell\n","x = \"Hello World\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5a5d7353","metadata":{},"source":["Once we have assigned a value to a variable, Python will remember this variable as long as the current session of Python is still running.\n","\n","Notice how writing x into the prompt below outputs the value “Hello World” after running the cell."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"80546c59","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["x"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d38d9ff","metadata":{},"source":["### Comments\n","Comments are lines of code that are not run by Python.
