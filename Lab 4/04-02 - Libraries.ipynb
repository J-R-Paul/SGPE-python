We explored Python basics, how to operate within a Jupyter Notebook, and briefly touched on importing modules. In this document, we will take a deeper dive into more advanced topics that are particularly relevant for econometric analyses. These include data manipulation using Pandas, numerical operations with NumPy, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation, plotting, and Monte Carlo simulations. \n",

    "6. Go back to (4) and repeat (4)-(5) until you have done it 10,000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a couple of functions to make our code more readable. The first function will be our DGP, which will generate a dataset of size $N$ and return the data as a Pandas DataFrame. The second function will be our OLS function, which will take our $X$ and $y$ matrices and return the OLS estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction to Functions in Python for Econometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. The concept is rooted in mathematical functions \\( f(x) \\), where an input \\( x \\) is mapped to an output \\( f(x) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Functions in Econometrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**: Functions encapsulate specific tasks, making it easier to manage large econometric models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Once defined, functions can be called multiple times with different data, reducing redundancy. This is particularly useful for bootstrapping, Monte Carlo simulations, and other iterative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Readability**: Using functions enhances code readability, enabling more straightforward interpretation of econometric methods being employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Debugging**: Isolated blocks of code are easier to troubleshoot than sprawling scripts, reducing the cost of error correction in stochastic simulations or complex econometric analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Define and Use Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining a Function\n",
    "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_ols(y, X):\n",
    "    # Code to perform OLS regression\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `calculate_ols` is the function name, and `y` and `X` are the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling a Function\n",
    "Once defined, call the function by its name followed by parentheses enclosing any arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "calculate_ols(y_data, X_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Statement\n",
    "To extract values from a function, use the `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_ols(y, X):\n",
    "    # Code to perform OLS regression\n",
    "    return beta_hat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameter vs Argument**: Parameters are variables listed during function definition. Arguments are the values passed to the function when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scope**: Variables defined inside a function have local scope, making them inaccessible outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Default Values**: Functions can have default parameter values, useful for setting typical econometric assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lambda Functions**: For simple, ad-hoc tasks, Python offers anonymous (lambda) functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions can accept other functions as parameters or return functions, providing flexibility in structuring econometric models.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Docstrings**: Always document what the function does, its parameters, and its output. This is crucial for reproducibility in econometric research.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering functions in Python, you can write more modular, readable, and reusable code—key traits for effective econometric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now define our DGP function which will have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = 3 + 2 X_{i} + \\epsilon_i\n",
