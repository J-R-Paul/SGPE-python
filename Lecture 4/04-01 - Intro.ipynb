Its simple and readable syntax makes it relatively easy to learn, while its many libraries and modules allow for advanced functionality.\n","\n","Python is a versatile language that can be used for various applications, from web development to data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and more. In econometrics, Python's powerful data analysis libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Statsmodels, make it an ideal tool for statistical analysis and modelling.\n","\n","### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n","\n","A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations, and text. The term \"notebook\" references the traditional notebook used in labs or research to keep track of one's work and observations.\n","\n","Jupyter notebooks support over 40 programming languages, including Python, and are widely used in data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualisation, machine learning, and more.\n","\n","Each notebook is made up of a series of cells. These cells can contain either code or markdown text. The markdown cells are used for text and include formatted text, images, hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, etc. The code cells contain the actual code that you want to run. You can run each cell individually, and it will display any output directly below the cell.\n","\n","### What is Binder?\n","\n","Binder is a free, open-source online service that allows you to turn a GitHub repository into a collection of interactive notebooks. It's powered by BinderHub, an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud. This makes it an excellent tool for sharing reproducible research, as others can view your work and interact with the code and data.\n","\n","In this class, we'll use Binder to host our Python notebooks. This means you can run and experiment with the code provided without needing to install Python or any of the necessary libraries on your local machine, and is what this notebook is running on right now.\n","\n","## Python Basics\n","\n","\n","### Variables\n","Variable assignment associates a value to a variable.\n","\n","Below, we assign the value “Hello World” to the variable x"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"7ed153ad","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["x = \"Hello World\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5a5d7353","metadata":{},"source":["Once we have assigned a value to a variable, Python will remember this variable as long as the current session of Python is still running.\n","\n","Notice how writing x into the prompt below outputs the value “Hello World”."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"80546c59","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'Hello World'"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["x"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d38d9ff","metadata":{},"source":["### Comments\n","Comments are lines of code that are not run by Python.
